*A collection of materials and experiments from a self-taught code enthusiast.*

## :checkered_flag: What is the goal of this repo?

As someone who learns by doing, I find great value in hands-on courses, creating projects and experimenting in general. However, these projects are often small and don't deserve their own repo, but at the same time, I don't want to just delete them. Therefore, this repository is a collection of this code and some learning sources I found along the way.
